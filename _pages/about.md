<!-- ## Welcome to the Algorithms and Architectures for Reasoning and Intelligent Automation Lab -->

The ARIA Research Lab in the Department of Computer Science at the Ying Wu College of Computing, New Jersey Institute of Technology (NJIT), led by Dr. Shivvrat Arya, develops methods for **trustworthy, structured, and efficient AI**. We work at the intersection of **neurosymbolic AI**, **probabilistic reasoning**, and **combinatorial optimization**, with applications in **computer vision**, **video understanding**, **human–AI interaction**, and **multimodal learning**.

## What we work on

The **Algorithms and Architectures for Reasoning and Intelligent Automation (ARIA) Lab** develops models and algorithms that unify structured reasoning with data-driven learning. Our research spans:

* **Neurosymbolic AI and Explainable Systems**
  Methods that integrate symbolic structure such as logic, constraints, and graphs with deep learning to enable transparent, controllable reasoning.

* **Probabilistic Modeling and Inference**
  Tractable and approximate inference in rich probabilistic models, including neural inference engines capable of answering complex queries at scale.

* **Neural Combinatorial and Constrained Optimization**
  Learning-based solvers for large-scale combinatorial and constrained reasoning tasks.

* **Reinforcement Learning for Graph Optimization**
  RL and graph neural network approaches for routing, scheduling, and graph-structured decision-making.

* **Applications in Vision, Video, and HCI**
  Structured and neurosymbolic methods for video understanding, activity recognition, augmented reality task guidance, and human–AI collaboration.

## Joining the lab

We are always looking for **curious, rigorous, and collaborative** students who are excited about building the next generation of **structured, explainable, and reliable AI systems**.

- **Ph.D. students**: Opportunities to work on core problems in neurosymbolic AI, probabilistic inference, graph optimization, and structured deep learning.
- **M.S. and undergraduate students**: Positions for research-oriented students interested in gaining hands-on experience with modern AI methods, systems building, and publications.

If you are interested in joining the ARIA Research Lab, please read the <a href="https://shivvrat.github.io/hiring/" target="_blank">hiring page</a> and follow the instructions there. Briefly describe your background, relevant coursework or projects, and which of the lab’s research directions you are most excited about.
