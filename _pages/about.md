<!-- ## Welcome to the Algorithms and Architectures for Reasoning and Intelligent Automation Lab -->

The ARIA Research Lab in the Department of Computer Science at the Ying Wu College of Computing, New Jersey Institute of Technology (NJIT), led by Dr. Shivvrat Arya, develops methods for **trustworthy, structured, and efficient AI**. We work at the intersection of **neurosymbolic AI**, **probabilistic reasoning**, and **combinatorial optimization**, with applications in **computer vision**, **video understanding**, **human–AI interaction**, and **multimodal learning**.

## What we work on

- **Neurosymbolic AI & Explainable Systems**: Integrating symbolic structure (logic, constraints, programs, graphs) with deep learning to enable transparent, controllable reasoning instead of black-box prediction.
- **Probabilistic Modeling & Inference**: Tractable and approximate inference in rich probabilistic models, including neural inference engines that answer complex queries in microseconds.
- **Neural Combinatorial & Constrained Optimization**: Learning-based and neural approaches for solving large-scale combinatorial problems and constrained reasoning tasks.
- **Deep Reinforcement Learning for Graph Optimization**: RL and graph neural network methods for routing, scheduling, and other graph-structured decision problems.
- **Applications in Vision, Video, and HCI**: Egocentric and third-person video understanding, activity recognition, augmented reality task guidance, and human–AI collaboration using structured and neurosymbolic models.

---

## Current research directions

- **Neurosymbolic models for reasoning under uncertainty**  
  We build models that combine deep neural architectures with symbolic and probabilistic structure to support tasks like explanation, counterfactual reasoning, and constrained decision-making.

- **Neural inference for probabilistic graphical models**  
  Our work on neural inference (e.g., **NeuPI**) learns to answer Most Probable Explanation (MPE) and related queries in complex probabilistic models, achieving orders-of-magnitude speedups over classical inference while preserving accuracy and structure.

- **Optimization-based and learning-based inference schemes**  
  We design optimization-inspired architectures (e.g., deep dependency networks and differentiable solvers) that leverage problem structure for multi-label prediction, structured outputs, and hybrid discrete–continuous reasoning.

- **Video understanding, activity recognition, and procedural tasks**  
  The lab develops models and datasets (e.g., **CaptainCook4D**) for understanding complex, multi-step tasks from video, focusing on explainable activity recognition, temporal reasoning, and predictive task guidance in AR.

## Selected projects & highlights

- **[NeuPI](https://neupi.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) – Neural Inference Engine**  
  A neural engine for probabilistic inference that accelerates reasoning in graphical models from minutes to microseconds, enabling real-time decision-making in structured domains.

- **[CaptainCook4D](https://captaincook4d.github.io/captain-cook/)**  
  A large-scale egocentric 4D dataset for procedural task understanding, used to study how AI systems perceive and reason about long-horizon activities in realistic, cluttered environments.

- **Explainable activity recognition & AR task guidance**  
  Models that not only recognize what people are doing but also provide structured, interpretable explanations and real-time guidance in augmented reality for complex tasks.

- **Award-winning work at top venues**  
  Lab publications have received **best paper awards**, **spotlights**, and **oral presentations** at venues such as NeurIPS, AISTATS, AAAI, and UAI.

## Joining the lab

We are always looking for **curious, rigorous, and collaborative** students who are excited about building the next generation of **structured, explainable, and reliable AI systems**.

- **Ph.D. students**: Opportunities to work on core problems in neurosymbolic AI, probabilistic inference, graph optimization, and structured deep learning.
- **M.S. and undergraduate students**: Positions for research-oriented students interested in gaining hands-on experience with modern AI methods, systems building, and publications.
